## Introduction

Breast cancer is a prevalent and potentially life-threatening disease. Predicting patient survival is crucial for determining appropriate treatment strategies and optimizing patient care. This project leverages machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model that estimates the likelihood of breast cancer patient survival based on key clinical and demographic factors.

## Dataset

The breast cancer dataset used in this project contains anonymized information about patients, including age, gender, protein levels, tumor stage, histology, receptor status, surgery type, and survival status. The dataset is stored in a CSV file named "BRCA.csv" and is available for download [here](https://example.com/dataset/brca_dataset.csv).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-survival-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd breast-cancer-survival-prediction`
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have the dataset "BRCA.csv" in the project directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `breast_cancer_survival_prediction.ipynb` in your preferred environment.
3. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the predictive model, and evaluate its performance.
4. Customize and tweak the code to experiment with different machine learning algorithms, feature engineering techniques, or hyperparameter tuning to enhance the model's performance.

## Results

Our trained breast cancer survival prediction model achieved an accuracy of XX% on the test set. This indicates its ability to predict patient survival based on the provided clinical and demographic features. However, please note that the accuracy may vary depending on the dataset used and the specific features considered.

For a detailed analysis of the results and visualizations of key features, please refer to the [breast_cancer_survival_prediction.ipynb](https://github.com/your-username/breast-cancer-survival-prediction/blob/main/breast_cancer_survival_prediction.ipynb) notebook.
